## Setting up your development environment

for your preferred editor(s).

## Development

Please refer to [`HACKING`][hacking] for contributions that add/change language
support, update behavior, etc.

## Making a pull request

Release notes are generated from pull request titles. So, when making a pull request,
consider what would make sense in a release note. The title shouldn't be too technical,
but should provide a clear summary that a user can understand.

### Example

#### OK

>Explicitly use RGB(0, 0, 0) and RGB(255, 255, 255) instead of built-in white and black

#### Better

>Increase contrast of colored terminal output
