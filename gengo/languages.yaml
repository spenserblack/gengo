# Definition of languages supported by Gengo
#
# # Format
#
# ```yaml
# # The name of the language.
# Language:
#
#   # data, markup, programming, or prose
#   category:
#
#   # The color associated with the language (unused).
#   color:
#
#   # Regexes unique to the contents of the file to resolve multiple matches. These will
#   # be used if the matchers (see below) cannot narrow down a file to a single
#   # language.
#   heuristics:
#     - "(?m)^macro_rules!"
#
#   # Entries to match against files. This is the first pass before more expensive
#   # strategies are used.
#   matchers:
#
#     # The file extensions associated with the language (optional)
#     extensions:
#       - "rs"
#
#     # The filenames associated with the language (optional)
#     filenames:
#       - "Dockerfile"
#
#     # Used for checking shebangs.
#     interpreters: # The interpreter(s) associated with the language (optional)
#       - "python"
#       - "python3"
#
#     # Advanced regex patterns associated with the language (optional)
#     patterns:
#       # See the format of the `regex` crate: https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
#       - "(?i)^(?:^|\/)__snapshots__\/.*\.snap$"
#
#   # Value between 0 and 100 to pick a language if multiple matches couldn't be
#   # narrowed down (optional, default: 50)
#   priority: 50
# ```
