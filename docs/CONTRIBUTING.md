# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Development

Please refer to [`HACKING`][hacking] for contributions that add/change language
support, update behavior, etc.

## Suggesting a new language

If you know about a language that this project should support, you can create a
[new issue][new-language-issue] to suggest adding support. You will be prompted
to provide information about the language that this project needs to add support.

## Making a pull request

Release notes are generated from pull request titles. So, when making a pull request,
consider what would make sense in a release note. The title shouldn't be too technical,
but should provide a clear summary that a user can understand.

### Example

#### OK

>Explicitly use RGB(0, 0, 0) and RGB(255, 255, 255) instead of built-in white and black

#### Better

>Increase contrast of colored terminal output

## For maintainers

### Showing appreciation

This project uses [all-contributors][all-contributors] to track contributions to help
show appreciation for all types of contributions. When a GitHub user contributes, don't
forget to ask the bot to track their contribution! For example, when adding support for
a new language, you can comment `@all-contributors add @USERNAME for data`.
