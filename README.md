A bit like [tokei][tokei], a lot like [linguist][linguist].

## Usage

This tool has multiple file sources. Each file source can have unique usage to take advantage of its
strengths and work around its weaknesses.

### Directory File Source


This is a very generic file source that tries not to make many assumptions about your environment
and workspace.

#### Ignoring Files

You can utilize a `.gitignore` file and/or an `.ignore` file to prevent files from
being scanned. See the [`ignore`][ignore-crate] for more details.

### Git File Source

The git file source is highly opinionated -- it tries to act like a git utility, and uses git tools.
Its goal is to behave similarly to [linguist].

#### Overrides

Like [linguist][linguist], you can override behavior using a `.gitattributes` file.
Basically, just replace `linguist-FOO` with `gengo-FOO`. *Unlike* linguist,
`gengo-detectable` will *always* make a file be included in statistics (linguist
will still exclude them if they're generated or vendored).

```gitattributes
# .gitattributes

# boolean attributes:

# These can be *negated* by prefixing with `-` (`-gengo-documentation`).
# Mark a file as documentation
*.html gengo-documentation
# Mark a file as generated
my-built-files/* gengo-generated
# Mark a file as vendored
deps/* gengo-vendored

# string attributes:
# Override the detected language for a file
# Use the Language enum's variant name (see docs.rs for more details)
templates/*.js gengo-language=PlainText
```

You will need to commit your `.gitattributes` file for it to take effect.
